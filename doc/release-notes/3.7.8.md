# Release notes for GlusterFS-v3.7.8
GlusterFS-v3.7.8 is a quick bugfix release done to solve a bug in 3.7.7 which prevented updates from successfully happening.

Release 3.7.7 included two changes to the AFR xlator, which broke rolling updates from pre 3.7.7 releases. The two offending patches have been reverted in 3.7.8 until a proper fix is found. The revert commits are

- de6e920 Revert "glusterd/afr: store afr pending xattrs as a volume option"
- d35e386 Revert "afr: warn if pending xattrs missing during init()"
